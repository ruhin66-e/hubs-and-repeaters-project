Today I learned how networks transfer data through hubs and repeaters! Hereâ€™s a quick overview:
ðŸ”¹ Hub: A hub is a basic networking device that connects multiple devices within a local network. It broadcasts data it receives to all connected devices, making it simple but inefficient. All devices share the same bandwidth, which can lead to network congestion.
ðŸ”¹ Repeater: A repeater boosts network signals to extend the range of transmission. It receives weak or low-quality signals and regenerates them, ensuring data can travel longer distances without loss or degradation
